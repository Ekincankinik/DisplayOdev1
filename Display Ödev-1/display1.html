 <h2>Abbas Kiarostami's "Where is My Friend's House" (1987) is a masterpiece.</h2>

<p class="text">
    
A paean to childhood kindness and a surprisingly thrilling odyssey, Where Is My Friend’s House? is a perfectly constructed film from Abbas Kiarostami. This is the second Kiarostami film I’ve seen (after Close-up, which earns my respect and awe more and more the longer it sits in my head) and it exceeded my expectations. 

Kiarostami has such a clear-eyed vision of what a film should be. As far as the camera work goes, what we see here seems to transcend the deliberate to achieve the purely instinctual. Of course, with any great movie that is probably never the case (hence “achieve the instinctual”), but there’s something to be said for a director who can make it seem that way. The way Kiarostami can capture such intense emotion in not just an actor’s face, but their movements, is beautiful. A specific shot that comes to mind is when Ahmed is weighing the decision to stay and obey his mother or peace out and take the notebook back to Mohammed Raza. The shot where you see him begin to walk behind the towel, pause, then go grab the notebook is genius. Mountains of stress is conveyed just through this kid's feet! Awesome.

Kiarostami's camera largely sticks right with the characters; typically they dictate the movement of the camera. Though, there are plenty of times when he’ll pull back to show a sort of landscape shot with the character finding his place(s) within the frame all in a single take. This contrast in shot technique, while individually offering emotional gratification on a moment-to-moment basis, ultimately compounds into a really cool, powerful experience. The more kinetic "following" shots get you really intimate with Ahmed, and then the usually static "landscape" shots give Ahmed's journey an epic quality. I was left just shaking my head a couple of times at how effective it all was. I guess this isn't necessarily unique to Kiarostami, but the precision with which he executes this synthesis is pitch-perfect.

Where Is My Friends House? is, I think, a sad story for a good chunk of the time. Though it ends on a note of quietly triumph that makes you grin from ear-to-ear, Kiarostami definitely makes us earn the ending by strapping us to Ahmed and forcing us to experience his frustrating helplessness and anxiety secondhand, which stems from his inability to communicate with the adults around him. Though, it’s not necessarily his inability to communicate as it is their unwillingness to listen (in fact he really has no problem getting his point across, he generally speaks his mind and he speaks it clearly). We come across people who are antagonistic, selfish, pig-headed, narrow-minded, and slow. Watching this film, you can't help but remember how difficult childhood can be.
    It's beautiful that Kiarostami has crafted a film is so authentically from the point of view of a little kid, not just in the frustration you feel for Ahmed but in emotional scope. The plot of Where Is My Friend's House? is almost impossibly contained: a boy needs to get his classmate's notebook back to him so said classmate doesn't get in trouble. Yet, his quest feels just as important as Frodo's trip to Mordor. I'd say this is due to Kiarostami not looking at Ahmed's journey through some sort of farcical or unnecessarily sentimental lens, as other filmmakers might. He takes it all just as seriously as Ahmed does, and views the series of events through his eyes. In turn, so do we, and the experience is genuine cinematic magic.</p>
